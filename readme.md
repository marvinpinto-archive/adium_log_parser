## About

![unmaintained](http://img.shields.io/badge/status-unmaintained-red.png)

These little scripts parse through Adium chat logs and format them into nice
little plaintext files. Given that I'll only need to do this *once*, I have put
zero effort into doing anything elegant here.

## Requirements

You will most likely need iso8601 as well, so:

```bash
$ pip install iso8601
```

## Resources

The bulk of imlog.py was shameless stolen from: [https://github.com/dustym/py-imlog](https://github.com/dustym/py-imlog).
